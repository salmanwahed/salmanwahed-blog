<h2>About</h2>

        <p>Hello! I'm Salman M Wahed, a passionate software engineer with over 11 years of experience in backend
            development and native Android applications. I graduated from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology
            with a BSc (Engg.) in Computer Science & Engineering, and have been actively contributing to the Bangladeshi
            software industry ever since.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I’ve led teams, architected scalable systems, and worked on high-impact projects, including
            a FinTech app used by millions. My technical toolkit includes Java, Spring Boot, Django, FastAPI, and
            Android, with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and clean architecture.</p>

        <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy swimming, cycling, and solving puzzles. I also love good sci-fi and am always up
            for a conversation about futuristic worlds or mind-bending plots. If you have an idea you're excited about
            or just want to chat about something interesting, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to new
            collaborations and meaningful discussions.</p>

        <p>If you’d like to know more about my experience and past projects, feel free to
